# Code Samples

## Examples of tests I have written in various frameworks and languages

- Languages
  - Javascript
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - Java
  - C#
- Frameworks
  - Chai 
  - Rails
  - Rspec
  - Mocha
  - Jasmine 
  - Selenium
  - Capybara
  - Protractor 
 - Features
   - Tags
   - Retry Flakies
   - Page Objects
   - ES6 Javascript
   - Happy, Sad, Smoke
   - Suites and Examples
   - Multi Browser Testing  
   - Before and Before Each for DRY code
</br></br>

The Javascript and Ruby examples are more complete and reflect languages I have used more extensively.</br>
Ruby is the best example of Page Objects, Retries and Tags.</br>

You can see a number of youtube videos of me coding TDD/BDD exercises in Ruby and Javascript at:
- [Ruby](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrVQWs0-8fJx0X6PMFQa0xbzKzS1_v8Vz)
- [Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrVQWs0-8fJzP8Rf8CY4zLna6MquJIlSb)
</br></br> 
They include some example of another favourite activity - refactoring.<br>
<br/>
Python, C# and Java are intended as basic templates for languages I have used less recently.
