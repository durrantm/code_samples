# Code Samples

## Examples of tests I have written in various frameworks and languages

- Languages
  - Javascript
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - C#
- Frameworks
  - Chai 
  - Rspec
  - Mocha
  - Jasmine 
  - Capybara
  - Selenium
  - Protractor 
</br>
The Javascript and Ruby examples are more complete and reflect languages I have used more extensively.

Python and C# are intended as simple basic templates for languages I have used less recently.
