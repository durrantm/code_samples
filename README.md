# Code Samples

## Examples of tests I have written in different frameworks and languages

- Javascript
- Python
- Ruby
- C#
- Protractor 
- Mocha
- Chai 
- Jasmine 
- Rspec
- Capybara
- Selenium

The javascript and Ruby examples are more complete and reflect languages I have used more.
Python and C# are intended as simple basic templates for languages I have used less.
