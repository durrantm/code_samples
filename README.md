# Test Code Examples

## Examples of how to write simple tests in different frameworks and languages

The [Javascript](https://github.com/durrantm/test_code_samples) and [Ruby](https://github.com/durrantm/test_code_samples/blob/master/spec_ruby_rspec_capybara_spec.rb) examples are more complete and reflect languages I have used more extensively.</br>
The Ruby code includes a examples of Page Objects, Retries and Tags.</br>
Python, C# and Java are intended as basic templates for languages I have used less recently or without webdriver.
