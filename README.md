The Javascript and Ruby examples are more complete and reflect languages I have used more extensively.</br>
Ruby is the best example of Page Objects, Retries and Tags.</br>

You can see a number of youtube videos of me coding TDD/BDD exercises in Ruby and Javascript at:
- [Ruby](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrVQWs0-8fJx0X6PMFQa0xbzKzS1_v8Vz)
- [Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrVQWs0-8fJzP8Rf8CY4zLna6MquJIlSb)
</br>
They include some simple examples of refactoring, which is another favourite activity of mine.<br>

Python, C# and Java are intended as basic templates for languages I have used less recently or not with webdriver.
